## Installation

.Net CLI

```
dotnet add package Notion.Net
```

**Note:** default Notion-Version used by NuGet package versions
| Package version | Notion-Version |
| --- | --- |
| 3.0.0+ | 2022-02-22 |
| 2.0.0+ | 2021-08-16 |
| 1.0.0+ | 2021-05-13 |

## Usage

> Before getting started, you need to [create an integration](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations) and find the token. You can learn more about authorization [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization).

Import and initialize the client using the integration token created above.

```csharp
var client = NotionClientFactory.Create(new ClientOptions
{
    AuthToken = "<Token>"
});
```

Make A request to any Endpoint. For example you can call below to fetch the paginated list of users.

```csharp
var usersList = await client.Users.ListAsync();
```

## Dependency Injection

Library also provides extension method to register NotionClient with Microsoft dependency injection.

```
services.AddNotionClient(options => {
  options.AuthToken = "<Token>";
});
```

### Querying a database

After you initialized your client and got an id of a database, you can query it for any contained pages. You can add filters and sorts to your request. Here is a simple example:

```C#
// Date filter for page property called "When"
var dateFilter = new DateFilter("When", onOrAfter: DateTime.Now);

var queryParams = new DatabasesQueryParameters { Filter = dateFilter };
var pages = await client.Databases.QueryAsync(databaseId, queryParams);
```

Filters constructors contain all possible filter conditions, but you need to choose only condition per filter, all other should be `null`. So, for example this code would not filter by 2 conditions as one might expect:

```C#
var filter = new TextFilter("Name", startsWith: "Mr", contains: "John"); // WRONG FILTER USAGE

```

To use complex filters, use class `CompoundFilter`. It allows adding many filters and even nesting compound filters into each other (it works as filter group in Notion interface). Here is an example of filter that would return pages that were due in past month AND either had a certain assignee OR had high urgency:

```C#
var selectFilter = new SelectFilter("Urgency", equal: "High");
var assigneeFilter = new PeopleFilter("Assignee", contains: "some-uuid");
var dateFilter = new DateFilter("Due", pastMonth: new Dictionary<string, object>());

var orGroup = new List<Filter> { assigneeFilter, selectFilter };
var complexFiler = new CompoundFilter(
    and: new List<Filter> { dateFilter, new CompoundFilter(or: orGroup) }
);
```

## Enable internal logs
The library make use of `ILoggerFactory` interface exposed by `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`. Which allow you to have ability to enable the internal logs when developing application to get additional information.

To enable logging you need to add the below code at startup of the application.

```csharp
// pass the ILoggerFactory instance
NotionClientLogging.ConfigureLogger(logger);

```

You can set the LogLevel in config file.
```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Notion.Client": "Trace"
    }
  }
}
```

You can also refer `examples/list-users` example.
